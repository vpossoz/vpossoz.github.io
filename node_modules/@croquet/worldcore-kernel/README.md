# Worldcore Kernel

Worldcore is a 3D game engine for Croquet. It is modular, extensible, and cross-platform.

You can use it to build multiuser webapps with hundreds or thousands of dynamic objects:

* 3D multiplayer games
* Multiuser AR & VR
* Shared visual simulations

Core Features:

* Automatic view rebuilding
* Built-in interpolation
* Speculative execution of avatars
* Player management
* DOM event handler

(**Note:** This the mininal installation that is *required* to run Worldcore. You will probably want to augment it with additional optional components.)
